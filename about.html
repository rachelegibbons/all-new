              <p>With over six years of experience in design, I am a seasoned designer with expertise in brand and UX work across a wide range of industries, including technology, entertainment, energy, and higher education.</p>

              <p>A lifelong learner and student of design, I have worked to combine my vast design knowledge with the engineering world in order to bridge the gap between clients, designers, and engineers through a common vocabulary and in-depth industry experience. I am a Human Interaction Design Foundation certified UX Designer, and a graduate of the Epicodus night school program, through which I gained a deeper understanding of engineering technologies and processes, while honing my front-end development skills. Through my experience with these programs in combination with my design-based skillset, I am able to precisely and efficiently craft solutions for clients that both solve their core issues while simultaneously meeting their high-level business objectives.</p>  

              <p>Apart from design, my experience in a variety of industries has helped me to broaden my skills to encompass brand engagement, marketing and advertising, project management, UX and digital capabilities, people management, and leadership.</p>

              <p>My primary passion is to provide helpful solutions in every context, while bringing an authentic design leadership voice to any team, no matter the size or setting.</p>
